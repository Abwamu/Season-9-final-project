## **Design Decisions**

### **Layout Adherence**
- Followed an **8-point spacing system** for consistent padding/margin.  
- Used Figma’s **Inspect Panel** to extract precise typography, spacing, and component dimensions.  
- Tailwind utilities mapped directly to Figma values for accurate rendering.  
- Images and icons optimized to match the design proportions without distortion.

### **Creative Departures**
- Additional structured sections were added for better storytelling.  
- Strengthened brand tone to make Electra-Hub feel more premium and trustworthy.  
- Mobile (MD breakpoint) redesigned to improve:
  - Readability  
  - Section stacking  
  - Spacing for touch interactions
